## 🎒 About this Quest

Software education is changing! Traditional credentials like certificates and diplomas are becoming less relevant. What's important now is your ability to build stuff that people use or like!

To help builders in this transition here's a new Quira experiment: _School of open source_!

This marks the beginning of a series of educational quests designed to help the community dive into various technologies. Join this quest if you want an excuse to tinker with different GenAI models or if you want to show the community what you're working on!

### Prizes 🧢

Yes, there will be prizes, but you should only do it for the learning and the fun!

1. To be eligible for a prize, your app must include one of the following APIs
  - 🐈💨 [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
  - 🇫🇷   [Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/)
  - 🦙   [Llama](https://llama.meta.com/docs/overview)
  - 🗿   [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api)
2. You can submit repositories used in a previous quest, provided they implement a new feature. The new feature should be described in the comments.
3. A sticker pack will be sent to the creators of the first 100 valid submissions.
4. A "Quira Creator" hat will be sent to the 5 creators that... 🙃

Plus the usual...
1. The content you submit to the quest must be original.
2. You are allowed to generate code with LLMs and to use StackOverflow, but the app/repo idea must be yours and yours only. If we detect plagiarism from other repo or user, your submission will be marked and you won't be eligible for a prize.
3. Your project must have a README and must clearly explain what the project does and how someone can run it or install it.
4. Team submissions are not supported in this quest.
5. You can only submit one repo. If you make a mistake, you have to remove the repo and upload a new one.

We might add new prizes & rules in a few weeks!

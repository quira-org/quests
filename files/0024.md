CopilotKit is an open-source tool that makes it extremely easy to integrate AI copilots into your React apps. Imagine in-app context-aware chatbots, AI-enhanced text fields, or in-app AI agents that interact seamlessly with both your application and its users. Currently, CopilotKit is working on [Co-Agents](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/coagents) a new product that provides infrastructure for connecting [LangGraph agents](https://www.langchain.com/agents) to humans in the loop.

This December, CopilotKit is releasing CoAgents v0.2 which includes LangGraph Cloud Support, LangGraph JS, and improved documentation. The challenge is to work on a CoAgents demo to help the CopilotKit team stress-test CoAgents and helping them find bug fixes.

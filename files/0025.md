## About this Quest

It was recently reported that a quarter of startups in YC‚Äôs current cohort have codebases that are almost entirely AI-generated. As AI products become more capable, we can expect this trend to spread to other companies and even to tasks in our own lives and workflows.

There's a lot of buzz about AI agents - and for good reason! Agents empower AI to interact with the world via APIs, enabling them to perform actions that can directly affect our lives. Imagine an agent that can make purchases, book flights, or even find a new job on your behalf.

Technically speaking, AI agents are LLMs equipped with a set of instructions and a toolbox. The instructions define the agent‚Äôs purpose and high-level objectives, while the toolbox provides the tools the agent needs to accomplish its tasks. You glue all of these together through an _agentic framework_.

This is the first in a series of agentic quests. Completing this quest will give you foundational experience in agent building, which will be useful for future challenges. In fact, the agents you create here may be eligible for submission in upcoming quests, so we recommend you give them a go!

## Main track

The goal of this quest is to build an open-source agent using an existing framework and showcase its capabilities. We recommend [SmolAgents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents), [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)/[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) or [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), but there are others like [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) & [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI).

You‚Äôre free to choose your agent‚Äôs function! For example, you can build

- Agents that browse the web to accomplish tasks.
- Agents that utilise integrations with your personal apps (Calendar, Gmail, Strava, etc.) to automate workflows.
- Agents that interact with your favorite IDEs to enhance developer productivity.
- ...and more!

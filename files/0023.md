## About Daytona

Daytona is a radically simple open-source development environment manager. Over time, setting up development environments has become increasingly challenging, but this complexity is unnecessary. With Daytona, all you need to do is execute a single command: `daytona create`. As a developer, you can immediately focus on what matters most—your code.

## 🌋 Challenge I: Create a sample for Daytona

| Start Date | End date | Prize pool |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| 3rd of December 2024 | **31st of December 2024** | $5,000 |

> 🚨 _**Projects for this phase are reviewed on an ongoing basis!**_

This track consists of creating a *sample project* for Daytona using the tech-stack of your preference. *Sample projects* are repositories that showcase how Daytona can be used with specific tech-stacks. Here’s what you have to do to unlock this, step by step 👇

1. Create a new repository from this template https://github.com/daytonaio/Sample-Template.
2. In this new repo, integrate Daytona into one of your previous projects (or build a new project if you prefer) and fill out the README as instructed in the template. The only restriction here is that the project must be your own - it can be a personal project, something you built for a Hackathon, or even a previous creator quest project. **_However, the @daytonaio team would really appreciate submissions that fall under [these themes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KaOAZY2CUWWr6bGY_iq_8I3NW7HNWzIE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107144603759549815194&rtpof=true&sd=true)._**
3. Make sure your project has a `devcontainer.json`, see [here](https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/builders/#dev-container) and [here](https://containers.dev/). You can generate one [with AI](https://devcontainer.ai/). Make sure that all the prerequisites in the samples themselves should be defined in devcontainer - sometimes the AI is not 100% accurate!
5. Submit your repo to the Quest.
6. The Quira team will review your project and if the prize pool hasn’t been depleted, we'll send you an email within 24 hours to confirm if the submission is valid. If it’s valid, we’ll send you instructions on how you can merge your sample repo into Daytona so you can claim the loot!


Notes:

- 💰 **Turbo Loot:** _The first 100 developers that complete this challenge will get a $50 reward._

- 💿 **Hint from @daytonaio**: _Submitting a project on any of [these themes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KaOAZY2CUWWr6bGY_iq_8I3NW7HNWzIE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107144603759549815194&rtpof=true&sd=true) will help you loot Challenge II._
  
- 🗣️ **Hint from @daytonaio**: _You should only pick a `language/stack` combination that you know and are comfortable coding with, but choosing one that is "not too common" will help your project stand out. For example:_
  
    `JS/(Node.js | React | Angular)`, `Python/(Django | Flask)`, `C#/(.NET Core | Xamarin)`, `PHP/(Laravel | Symfony)`, `Ruby/Rails`, `Go/(Gin | Beego)`, `Swift/(Vapor | Kitura)`, `TS/(Angular | NestJS)`, ...

- 👾 **Need help?**: _If you have any questions you can get help in our Discord channel._


## ⛰️ Challenge II: Content & Tutorials

| Start Date | End date | Prize pool |
| --- | ---  | --- |
| 27th of November 2024 | 10th of January 2025 | $1,000 |

This challenge consists in creating content or tutorials that show others how you integrated Daytona in your projects or why you found it useful. There are two steps here:

1. Take the sample project you created for the Challenge I and either,
    1. Write an article to share your experience with the community.
    2. Create a new tutorial explaining how you used Daytona for one of your projects. Aim this tutorial at developers with a similar level of experience.

> 👀 Note that if you submitted a project to Challenge #1, you can add a link to your blogpost at any point before the quest ends by editing your submission.

This quest will follow a points-based system.

| Points | Rewarded if |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | Star https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/ |
| 50 | You created a valid Sample Project (it doesn’t matter if you didn’t loot Challenge 1!) and used it to write a tutorial or article! |
| 45 | Awarded by judges based on the novelty, originality, and quality your submission. |

> 🚨 **To judge the orignality, the judges will pay particular attention to the "rarity" of the `language/stack` chosen to build the Sample and that the respository uses one of [these themes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KaOAZY2CUWWr6bGY_iq_8I3NW7HNWzIE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107144603759549815194&rtpof=true&sd=true).**

Reward structure:

| Reward | Rewarded to… |
| --- | --- |
| $2 | … the first 100 submissions scoring 55 points. |
| $10 | 11th place - 25th place |
| $50 | 3rd place - 10th place |
| $100 | 2nd place |
| $150 | 1st place |

Note that:

- A submission will be regarded valid if adheres to our [standard quest rules](https://docs.quira.sh/for-developers/quests/creator-quests/quest-standard-rules).
- Remember that for content use of AI is permitted, but if a content piece is evidently generated with AI it will be disqualified.
